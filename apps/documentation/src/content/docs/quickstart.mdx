You can use this template on Github and start coding immediately.

Once your project is created, follow these steps:

## 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required tools installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 24.10.0)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) (version 10.5.2)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

You can use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) for managing your Node version:

```bash
fnm use 24.10.0
npm i -g pnpm@10.5.2
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

## 3. Run the Setup Script

The project includes an automated setup script that will:
- Detect available applications (API, Web SPA, Web SSR, OpenAPI Generator)
- Prompt you for database configuration (user, password, name, host, port)
- Prompt you for application ports
- Configure SMTP settings (MailDev)
- Copy and configure all `.env` files automatically
- Optionally start Docker services (database, MailDev)
- Optionally run database migrations

Run the setup script:

```bash
pnpm rock
```

The script will guide you through the configuration process interactively. It will:
- Ask for your project name
- Update package.json files for detected applications with the project name
- Check for existing `.env` files and only prompt for missing variables
- Automatically update all `.env` files with your configuration
- Set up proper API URLs and trusted origins across all applications

## 4. Start Development

After the setup is complete, start the development servers:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Optional: Manual Setup

If you prefer to configure everything manually, you can:
1. Select which provided modules you do not need. Follow the according Explanations page to remove them cleanly
2. Manually copy and configure `.env` files from `.env.example` files
3. Start Docker services: `pnpm docker:up`
4. Run migrations: `pnpm --filter=api db:migrate:up`
