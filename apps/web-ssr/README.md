# Web Application

## Overview

This is the web frontend application of our project, built with modern React and a robust set of tools for an optimal development experience.

## Tech Stack

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JavaScript with syntax for types
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework
- [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - Re-usable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS
- [React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/) - Declarative routing for React
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) - Powerful asynchronous state management
- [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/latest) - Headless UI for building powerful tables
- [TanStack Form](https://tanstack.com/form/latest) - Powerful and type-safe form builder

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v8 or higher)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Setup env variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Start the development server
- `pnpm build` - Build the application for production
- `pnpm preview` - Preview the production build locally

# SSR (Server-Side Rendering) Application

This application uses server-side rendering (SSR) to improve performance and SEO.

## Environment Variables

Unlike a SPA, an SSR application can use environment variables at runtime because rendering is done on the server side.

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `API_URL` | Backend API URL | Yes | - |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment (development, production) | No | `development` |

In Vite-powered SSR applications, environment variables prefixed with `VITE_` are exposed to the client-side bundle and are accessible via `import.meta.env`.
This is required when you need to configure client-side code, such as API clients, with environment-specific values at build time.

For this app, **`VITE_API_URL`** must be set in your environment for the client to know where to send requests.
You can see this used in [`app/root.tsx`](./app/root.tsx) as:

```ts
client.setConfig({
  baseUrl: import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL,
  credentials: 'include',
})
```

If you use the provided `.env.example` file, remember to set the appropriate `VITE_API_URL` for your backend API.

> **Note:** Client-side code cannot access unprefixed server `.env` variables. Always use the `VITE_` prefix for values needed in the browser.

See [.env.example](/apps/web-ssr/.env.example) as a reference.

## Building with Docker

### Building the Image

```bash
# At the project root
docker build -t lonestone/web-ssr -f apps/web-ssr/Dockerfile .
```

### Running the Container

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e API_URL=https://api.example.com \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  lonestone/web-ssr
```
